# Practice Hiragana with Flashcards

## Japanese Language
Japanese Language has three writing systems. 
### Kanji
The most complicated scrip is called Kanji, and it is made up of thousands of characters borrowed from Chinese. While some changes have happened over the years, many people who can read and write in Mandarin find they can read and write in Japanese.

Kanji is used for formal documents, proper names, and certain terms. Kanji has traditionally been used for almost all words, but over time, it has fallen in popularity. 

### Hiragana
The second script is called Hiragana. Hiragana is a syllabary. It is similar to an alphabet, but each character makes up a syllable or whole sound. There are 46 base characters which together make up the sounds of the Japanese language. 

Hiragana originated in the 600s CE as simplified Chinese characters that stood for sounds rather than whole words. It further developed as a script to be used by women, who were not permitted higher education. 

In modern times, Hiragana has grown in popularity due to its simplicity. Today, many signs and printed materials in Japan will include the Hiragana for a Kanji in small text above or beside it. 

### Katakana
The third script is called Katakana. Katakana is almost identical to Hiragana but appears slightly different. It helps to think of Katakana as the italicized version of Hiragana. Katakana is used to write foreign words and add emphasis.

### Intent
The intent of this web app is to provide a simple environment of flashcards to practice the 46 Hiragana characters. While this does not give the learner access to all of Japanese language, it is a sufficient place to start. 

### Gameplay
The 26 Hiragana characters are loaded in as the front of each flash card. The back shows the sound written in English characters (called Romanji in Japanese). The answer section allows the learner to write what sound the character makes. Clicking Flip will allow the use to see the back of the card and find out if their guess was correct.

If the learner does not recognize the character, they can press the Hint button to get a helpful mnemonic to remember the character.

At the end, the game will automaticlly reshuffle the cards and move the ones that the learner got wrong to the top of the deck. The learner can also have the deck shuffled at any time by clicking the Re-shuffle
