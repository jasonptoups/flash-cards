# flash-cards

## User Stories
### MVP
* User should encounter a website with preloaded flashcards for learning hiragana
* User should see characters and type in their guess for the sound
* The program should tell the user if they were right or wrong 
* User should be able to go to the next card or review the last one
* At the end, the program should tell the user which ones they know well and which they need to practice
* Each character should have a hint to help learn it. Using the hint counts as getting the sound wrong. 

### Extra Features
* Have a pretty landing page
* Color it in a japanese themed way
* Next time the user plays, the program should order the cards from most mistaken to least mistaken
* The program should somehow store score over time from the user. Not sure how to do that...
* The user should be able to go the other way: drawing the character based on the sound. The user should self grade themselves in this case.
